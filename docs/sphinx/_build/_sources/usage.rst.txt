=================

Vapor3 is comprised of a set of tools called Renderers.  Each Renderer depicts your data with color and opacity based on your specifications, provided through Vapor's user interface.

The QuickStart Guide will show you how to install Vapor3, load some data, and create your first renderer.  The next step is to then learn about the Variables, Appearance, Geometry, and Annotation tabs, which are used to specify Renderer behavior.  From here, we document each renderer individually, noting their behavior and unique attributes that they may exhibit.  

We then cover some computational and diagnostic tools included in Vapor3.  Finally, we talk about Vapor3's supported data formats, and the VDC data format which can greatly reduce Renderer computation time and enable easier data exploration.
